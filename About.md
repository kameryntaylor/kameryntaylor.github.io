HELLO WORLD,

My name is Kameryn, I'm a Security Researcher. I hold Bachelors of Science Degree in Computer Science from California State University, Sacramento; I concentrationed in Information Assurance and Security or commonly known as "Cyber Security". I currently hold my SANS Institute Security Essentials (SANS GSEC) certification. An interesting tidbit of information about SANS Institute certifications is that you are allowed any paper material in the test room. I must have had over 50 multicolored tabs in the provoded textbooks XD (I'll insert a photo below).

I plan to complete many more certifications including CISSP, CCNA, and Network +. I find I have an affinity for Network Security. 

I am researching cyber security and religion. This site is mainly to post and show case my cyber security research.

My core value is compassion. In my professional life this value helps me connect and inspire those around me; together producing good quality work.
