HELLO WORLD,

My name is Kameryn, I'm a Security Researcher completing prereq's for Graduate school. I've decided to obtain a Masters Degree in Mathematics & Statistics. I hold Bachelors of Science Degree in Computer Science from California State University, Sacramento; I concentrationed in Information Assurance and Security or commonly known as "Cyber Security". Working for the Califnornia Department of Transportation as an IT Associate, I was fortunate enough to have them sponser my enrollment in SANS Insitute Security Essentials(SANS GSEC) course. I was happy to pass the certification exam that followed the 4-month course. An interesting tidbit of information about SANS Institute certifications is that you are allowed any paper material in the test room. I must have had over 100 multicolored tabs in the provoded textbooks XD (I'll insert a photo below).

I plan to complete many more certifications including CISSP, CCNA, and Network +. I find I have an affinity for Network Security. 

Currently, I am on a mission to find the connect between religion, math, and cyber security. Wouldn't it be monumental if we could use math; that can be taught in early schooling, to build holy ground-placement of trees/design of buildings that welcome angels and favorible spirits or maybe even a mathematical formula to remember a scripture? We could transform the entire United States! My learning style is Trial and Error.

Some of my values are possessing the ability to love all, treating others nobly, and the presence of compassion. These values help me connect and inspire those around me; producing good quality work.

This is just a page of knowlegde I've aquired over the years as an analyst. I thought I'd share since it's hard getting this type of advice. I know what it's like to not have someone to go to as a mentor figure for advice. Hopefully I can make your journey easier than mine :)
