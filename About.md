HELLO WORLD,

I am on a mission to find the connect between math, religion, and cyber security. I am a Security Analyst currently looking for work. I grauated from California State University, Sacramento with a Degree in Computer Science and a concentration in Inforation Assurance and Security (Cyber Security). I have since obtained my first SANS cert the SANS GSEC.
