HELLO WORLD,

I am on a mission to find the connect between math, religion, and cyber security. I am a Security Analyst currently looking for work. I grauated from California State University, Sacramento with a Bachelors of Science Degree in Computer Science and a concentration in Information Assurance and Security (Cyber Security). I have since obtained my first SANS cert the SANS GSEC or Security Essentials. My learning style is Trial and Error.
  
  
This is just a page of knowlegde I've aquired over the years, I thought I'd share since it's hard getting this type of advice. I know what it's like to not have someone to go to as a mentor figure for advice. Hopefully I can make your life easier than mine :)
