HELLO WORLD,

My name is Kameryn, I'm a Security Researcher completing prereq's for Graduate school. I've decided to obtain a Masters Degree in Mathematics & Statistics. I hold Bachelors of Science Degree in Computer Science from California State University, Sacramento; I concentrationed in Information Assurance and Security or commonly known as "Cyber Security". Working for the California Department of Transportation as an IT Associate, I was fortunate enough to have my enrollment in SANS Insitute Security Essentials(SANS GSEC) course sponsered. I was happy to pass the certification exam that followed the 4-month course. An interesting tidbit of information about SANS Institute certifications is that you are allowed any paper material in the test room. I must have had over 100 multicolored tabs in the provoded textbooks XD (I'll insert a photo below).

I plan to complete many more certifications including CISSP, CCNA, and Network +. I find I have an affinity for Network Security. 

In addition to Math school part-time, I am researching religion, math, and cyber security. This site is mainly to post and show case my research. I want to find the connection between religion, math, and cyber security. Wouldn't it be monumental if we could use math; that can be taught in early schooling, to build holy ground; the placement of trees, the design of buildings that welcome angels and favorible spirits; maybe even a mathematical formula to remember a scripture and maybe, because the ground is holy it will be cyber secured because of the level of protection from other forces/ a safe haven to develop a new internet? We could transform the entire United States! My learning style is Trial and Error.

Some of my values are possessing the ability to love all, treating others nobly, and the presence of compassion in people I meet. In my professional life these values help me connect and inspire those around me; producing good quality work.

I thought I'd share this online since it's hard getting this type of advice. I know what it's like to not have someone to go to as a mentor type. Hopefully I can make your journey easier than mine :)
