Hello, 

So there are three hobbies I wish to share with the world :) 1) Jewelry Making. 2) Acrylic Painting. and 3) Music.

On this page I will be posting images of my home made jewelry available for sale [here]. Every purchase comes with a free painting. Some examples of my paintings are below. 

Next, I love making playlists helping people get through their day. Email/Text me (see ![about me]() for contact info) if you would like a playlist made taylored to your spirit. I do ask that you provide me with one song to go off of and a photo you feels represents you. Also search my music profile on YouTube! Search: "Kameryn Janai Taylor" on YouTube.

If we could summarize the holy trinity's advice into one word, God would say Trust me, Jesus would say Surrender to your love, and the Holy Sprit will say Believe in change when it comes into your awareness.

<!--- (tsb2) This painting is inspired by the verse " I, Paul, myself entreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ--I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold toward you when I am away!--" - 2 Corinthians 10:1 --->
<!--- (tsb3) This painting is about American image of BEAUTY. The three dots are reflected so they should be seen as three not six; it represents the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The smudged grey lettering in the background says: “Trust” “Surrender” “Believe” in that order. --->
<!--- (tsb4) This picture has the wording "trust, believe, surrender" smeared in grey in the background. The wording warns the others to "stay away" from the owner of the painting.---> 
<!--- (tsb5) This picture has the wording "trust, believe, surrender" smeared in grey in the background. The text asks the question "where are my friends?, it also warns to stay peaceful"  --->
