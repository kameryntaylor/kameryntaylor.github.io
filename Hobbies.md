HI! here are three hobbies I wish to share with the world :) 1) Jewelry Making. 2) Acrylic Painting. and 3) Music.

On this page I will be posting images of my home made jewelry available for sale [here](https://www.instagram.com/elevatedjewls/). Every purchase comes with one of my revelotionary acrylic painting. Some examples of my paintings are below. 

Next, I love making playlists to help people get through their day. Email/Text me (see "About Me" page above for contact info) if you would like me to make you a playlist. I don't mind getting emails/texts from strangers for requests! I promise. With your request please provide a song that really starts you. I will post the fresh playlist to my music profile on YouTube; typically the next day. Search: "Kameryn Janai Taylor" on YouTube and click the playlists tab or click the link below. Music really introduces new perspectives on conditions we are all facing. Music reveals that it is COMMON to experience misfortunes such as Homelessness, Debt, Health Drops/Mental Illness breakouts, etc. I want to boost your life through music.

## Painting Examples

If we could summarize the holy trinity's advice into one word, God would say Trust me, Jesus Christ would say Surrender to your love and Faith, and the Holy Sprit will say Believe in change when it comes into your awareness.

<!--- (tsb2) This painting is inspired by the verse " I, Paul, myself entreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ--I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold toward you when I am away!--" - 2 Corinthians 10:1 --->
<!--- (tsb3) This painting is about American image of BEAUTY. The three dots are reflected so they should be seen as three not six; it represents the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The smudged grey lettering in the background says: “Trust” “Surrender” “Believe” in that order. --->
<!--- (tsb4) This picture has the wording "trust, believe, surrender" smeared in grey in the background. The wording warns the others to "stay away" from the owner of the painting.---> 
<!--- (tsb5) This picture has the wording "trust, believe, surrender" smeared in grey in the background. The text asks the question "where are my friends?, it also warns to stay peaceful"  --->
