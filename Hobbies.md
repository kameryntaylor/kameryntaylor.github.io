HI! here are three hobbies I wish to share with the world :) 1) Music 2) Acrylic Painting.

I recommend the Pandora music app to find new music.

## Painting Examples

If we could summarize the holy trinity's advice into one word, God would say Trust me, Jesus Christ would say Surrender to your love, and the Holy Sprit will say Believe in change when it comes into your awareness.

<!--- (tsb2) This painting is inspired by the verse " I, Paul, myself entreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ--I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold toward you when I am away!--" - 2 Corinthians 10:1 --->
<!--- (tsb3) This painting is about American image of BEAUTY. The three dots are reflected so they should be seen as three not six; it represents the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The smudged grey lettering in the background says: “Trust” “Surrender” “Believe” in that order. --->
<!--- (tsb4) This picture has the wording "trust, believe, surrender" smeared in grey in the background. The wording warns the others to "stay away" from the owner of the painting.---> 
<!--- (tsb5) This picture has the wording "trust, believe, surrender" smeared in grey in the background. The text asks the question "where are my friends?, it also warns to stay peaceful"  --->
