This is just a page of knowlegde I've aquired over the years, I thought I'd share since it's hard getting this type of advice. I know what it's like to not have someone to go to as a mentor figure for advice. Hopefully I can make your life easier than mine :)

**What I learned in coding:** Never copy other peers around you on a way to approach a project, always get as close to the source as possible and derive your own approach to solving pallet
