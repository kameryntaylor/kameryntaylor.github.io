## Digest

What I've learned,
- God is in control of everyone
- Building communication stamina is essential to reach persons and change minds

### Disclaimer: I do not expect you to accept my verses below as correct, although I did try my best to get them right I may have mis-typed/mis-spelled. Ive decided not to add the scripture source so that you can become more familiar with the Bible and find where the verse is in the Bible on your own! I will say these all come from the New Testament.

"It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus." 
"an instrustor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth--"  
"Their feet are swift to shed blood;"  
"More than that, we also know rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through who we have now received reconciliation"  
"for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law."  
"When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour."  
"They we told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads."  
"God exalted him at his right has as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Isreal and forgiveness of sins."  
"In the meantime, when so many thousands of people had gathered together that they were tramplinong one another, he began to say to his diciples first, "Beware of tge leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."  
"Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, "I will; be clean."

**What I learned in coding,**  Never copy other peers around you on a way to approach a project, always get as close to the source as possible and derive your own approach to solving the problem.

## New Language - Feelo (pronounced fuh-lay-oh)
Whats up! So I've invented a new language since I regularly get frustrated with english. 

I've named it Feelo because its primarity based on a sense. You just put paint to paper and let the Lord lead you. It is only a written language and must be done with paint. The idea behind interpreting it is the symbols written down are translated differently. So one person might look at a symbol/sentence and get "forgiveness" however, another person might look at the same writing and get "hope". The idea behind it is that God has different message for everyone and the same situation can transform both peoples live in there respective paths differently. What one is supposed to do in their life will be unintelligible to another unless explained by that person. This is meant to empower the population. :D

Some examples of feelo are in my paintings on the "My Hobbies" page. I will paint more messages from God and post them here. Enjoy! :)
