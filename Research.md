### Disclaimer: I do not expect you to accept my verses below as correct, although I did try my best to get them right I may have mis-typed/mis-spelled. Ive decided not to add the scripture source so that you can become more familiar with the Bible and find where the verse is in the Bible on your own! I will say these all come from the New Testament.

"It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus." 
(PMFormula For Scripture: gmr/2-)  
"an instrustor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth--"  
"Their feet are swift to shed blood;"  
"More than that, we also know rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through who we have now received reconciliation"  
"for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law."  
"When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour."  
"They we told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads."  
"God exalted him at his right has as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Isreal and forgiveness of sins."  
"In the meantime, when so many thousands of people had gathered together that they were tramplinong one another, he began to say to his diciples first, "Beware of tge leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."  
"Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, "I will; be clean."
