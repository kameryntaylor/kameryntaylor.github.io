This is just a page of knowlegde I've aquired over the years, I thought I'd share since it's hard getting this type of advice since both my parents have now passed away. I know what it's lilke to not have someone to go to as a mentor/parent figure for advice. Mom died of breast cancer and Dad died because of something to do with his heart, I never knew. Hopefully I can make your life easier than mine :)

**What I learned in coding:** Never copy other peers around you on a way to approach a project, always get as close to the source as possible and derive your own approach to solving pallet  
**We all know all things come from GOD so what is he saying for the year 2021?** Thessalonians is my favorite chapter, ask me why.
